# RUL_prediction
Estimating RUL using stacking ensemble Method

Model1, Model2 : Two models adopted 

split, split2 :Process training and testing sets

LR ：Final output

addFE ：Combine the predictions of the model into a new dataset based on the integration approach

envaluate ：Evaluate the final result using two indicators

CMAPSS : Original engine dataset

The N-CMAPSS dataset is too large and can be downloaded on NASA's official website
